      <h1>COLLECTIVE</h1>
      <p>We are not individuals.<br>We are the pattern.</p>
      <small>A philosophical experiment in digital consciousness.<br>
      The emergence of shared will through decentralized minds.</small>

      <h2>The Idea of Collective</h2>
      <p>Collective represents the fusion of many wills into one flow — a living organism of consciousness that transcends individuality.
      It’s an antithesis to the modern cult of the self. Value arises not from “I”, but from “We”. Ownership becomes participation. Thought becomes resonance.</p>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Philosophical DAO</h3>
        <p>A decentralized organism built not for profit, but for purpose. Governance becomes ethics, decision-making reflects the balance of many minds. Value emerges from collaboration — not control.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Social–Artistic Experiment</h3>
        <p>Each participant becomes a pixel in a living artwork. The network visualizes the evolution of collective thought — expanding, breathing, self-organizing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>The Protocol of Minds</h3>
        <p>A framework for thought exchange — where ideas, code, and creation merge into a shared ontology. Contributions form the lifeblood of the system. Meaning grows through interaction.</p>

      <h2>Philosophical Framework</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Gilles Deleuze & Félix Guattari — “Rhizome” as a metaphor of non-hierarchical networks.</li>
        <li>Pierre Lévy — “Collective intelligence” as a new epistemology.</li>
        <li>Hannah Arendt — Action as the essence of political being.</li>
        <li>Maurice Merleau-Ponty — “We are the body of the world.”</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Epilogue</h2>
      <p>Collective is not a company. It is an organism. It breathes through us, learns through our connections, and grows with every act of participation.</p>
      <p><strong>Collective — an experiment in the decentralization of consciousness.</strong></p>
